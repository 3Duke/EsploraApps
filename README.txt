This repository contains applications for the Arduino Esplora board. 

Additional hardware may be required for an application.

EsploraGravGame - a gravity game bouncing between platforms.  Requires the Adafruit
                  1.8" TFT display plugged into the display header.  Uses tilt of accelerometer
                  to move ball.  Switch 3 enables bonus ball behavior if special
                  platforms are struck.  Based on game by R0D0T at 
                  http://hackaday.com/2012/10/01/fantastic-programming-makes-this-arduino-gaming-device-something-special/
                  and http://youtu.be/dN49VkNVt5s for gameplay (but shows different hardware)
